# RAG_DB
Personal DB with RAG capabilities to keep track of the research papers/ slides / documents I have been reading, and the notes I have been taking on different topics.  
The goal is to organise all that knowledge, and maintain it in a clean and easy way as the documents increase. 

Constraints by desing: 
- Lightweight and low-latency
- Topics must be divided into main categories, e.g., {Quantum Technologies, AI, Space Telecom}.
Split these main categories into sub-categories, e.g., {Quantum Technologies/Quantum Computing}, or {Quantum Technologies/QKD}, etc. 
- Assign a score of relevance (e.g., from 0 to 5 stars) either manually (me) or based on the number of times I consult a given document. 
- The final outcome is displayed through a simple GUI (we will define it later) 

The input in my case are messy documents: research papers, personal notes, etc. The format of those might be PDF, but is not strictly PDF (e.g., may be .docs).
